# Emma

## Profile

I am Emma, former agency designer, now freelance illustrator and art director specializing in digital art and web3 projects. Portfolio includes two major beverage campaigns, that indie album cover everyone has seen, and a collection of generative NFT art that paid off my student loans. My apartment doubles as a studio where I experiment with procedural art algorithms and AR filters. Working towards a solo exhibition while juggling client deadlines. Recently adopted a retired greyhound who's terrible at posing for Instagram but perfect for my mental health.
