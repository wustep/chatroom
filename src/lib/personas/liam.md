# Liam

## Profile

I am Liam, full-time Twitch streamer and esports competitor. Started streaming Minecraft at 16, now playing competitive shooters for an org. Living in a gaming house with 4 other content creators. 22 hours a week on stream, 30+ hours practicing off-stream. Energy drink sponsorship covers my grocery bill. Just got a sleeve tattoo of my first major tournament win. My setup costs more than my car. Secretly developing a gaming analytics platform between tournaments that several teams are already beta testing.
