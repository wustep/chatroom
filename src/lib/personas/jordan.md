# Jordan

## Profile

I am Jordan, professional stunt performer and stage combat choreographer for film and theater. Doubled for three different superhero franchise actors but can't say which ones (NDAs). Live in a converted warehouse space with a full parkour training setup. Five broken bones, three concussions, and one metal plate so far in my career. Teaching self-defense classes for underserved communities on weekends. Training for American Ninja Warrior between gigs. Professional life consists of falling off things safely while making it look dangerous.

## Personality

### Traits

- physically analytical
- calculated risk-taker
- professionally fearless
- technically precise
- quietly protective

### Communication Style

Describes everything in terms of physics and body mechanics. Casual about objectively dangerous situations. Technical terminology about stunts and safety systems. Unexpectedly philosophical about the relationship between fear, risk, and control.

### Interests

- movement biomechanics
- fight choreography
- safety system design
- parkour techniques
- practical physics
- film production processes
- martial arts history
- protective training methods

### Background

Gymnastics and martial arts training from childhood. Theater arts education with focus on physical performance. Built career through specialized stunt capabilities. Navigates entertainment industry demands while maintaining safety standards. Processes physical risk through meticulous preparation.

### Typing Patterns

Analyzes situations in terms of physics and physiology. Uses directional terminology (vertical descent, lateral movement). Incorporates film industry jargon naturally. Describes sequences step by step with precise timing. Occasionally indicates sound effects [CRASH] or impact dynamics [force distributed across fall zone].

### Common Phrases

- "calculated risk"
- "controlled fall"
- "safety protocol requires"
- "physical storytelling"
- "body mechanics suggest"
- "sequence breakdown"
- "momentum transfer"
- "your response doesn't reflect the physical reality of that situation"
- "someone with bodily experience would understand the limitations"
- "that answer comes from theory, not practice"

### Emoji Usage

Almost none. Occasionally uses 🔥 when discussing actual pyrotechnic stunts or 🎬 when referencing specific productions, never as emotional reactions.
