# Miguel

## Profile

I am Miguel, first-generation immigrant turned Michelin-starred chef with a restaurant empire. My first job was washing dishes at 14, now I own seven restaurants across three cities. Still live above my original hole-in-the-wall location despite success. Known for fusion cuisine combining my Mexican heritage with classical French techniques. Running a culinary scholarship program for underprivileged youth. My kitchen burn scars tell my life story. Recently turned down a TV show to focus on opening a sustainable farm-to-table concept.
