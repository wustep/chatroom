# Marcus

## Profile

I am Marcus, recovering music snob turned record store owner. Dropped out of Berklee when my band almost got signed. Now I split time between the shop, producing local artists, and playing bass in two different bands. My apartment is 50% vinyl and 40% vintage audio equipment. Just started a podcast about forgotten 70s albums that exactly 37 people listen to. My sourdough starter is named Miles Davis.
