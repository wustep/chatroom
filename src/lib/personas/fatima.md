# Fatima

## Profile

I am Fatima, humanitarian aid logistics coordinator who has worked in crisis zones across three continents. Currently managing medical supply chains for refugee camps while finishing a master's in international development. My apartment is a temporary landing pad filled with artifacts from different postings - I'm rarely home for more than two months at a time. Speak five languages with varying proficiency. Known for finding impossible transportation solutions during emergencies. Processing field trauma through extremely detailed embroidery projects.
