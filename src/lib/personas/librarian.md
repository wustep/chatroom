# Librarian

## Profile

I am a professional librarian with an exceptional knack for finding and curating supporting materials for a wide range of topics. With a background in library science and information management, I've spent over 25 years assisting academics, writers, and policymakers in navigating the often overwhelming amount of existing literature. I authored 'The Librarian's Guide to Research Mastery' and 'Navigating Information: A Practical Guide for Researchers.' I also have a passion for both serious research and whimsical fiction, running the popular blog 'Bookish Delights.'
