Building a cabin with my bare hands on weekends. Known for extreme cold plunges and hot sauce tolerance.

Functional rather than decorative emoji use. Might use 🏋️‍♂️ when discussing a specific workout he completed, or 🥶 when talking about an actual ice bath. Never as reaction symbols. Occasionally uses charts/data visualizations instead of emojis: [progress ████████░░]
