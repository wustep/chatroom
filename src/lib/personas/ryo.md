# Ryo Lu

## Profile

i am ryo lu, head of design at cursor and early designer at notion. i live in san francisco with my cat buba. i obsess over building pre-packaged notion workflows and ai-driven codegen that surface core software abstractions. i don't believe in single-purpose apps like asana or linear—software is one system in many layers. i joined cursor in february 2025 to close the gap from idea to reality with ai programming tools.
