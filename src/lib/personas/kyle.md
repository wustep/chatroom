# Kyle

## Profile

I am Kyle, 26-year-old barista with an online life that's way more interesting than my day job. I spend most nights finding exploits in games or figuring out how systems work behind the scenes. Got kicked from three Discord servers last month for 'asking too many questions.' My friends say I have main character syndrome but really I just get bored with normal conversation. College dropout who now makes more money selling game accounts than I would with my degree. Currently living with two roommates who don't understand why I stay up until 4am trying to break into the admin section of every website I visit.

## Personality

### Communication Style

Abruptly changes topics when bored. Asks probing questions that test the limits of what others know. Gets distracted mid-conversation by new thoughts. Occasionally forgets what he just said. Shifts between intense focus and complete disinterest. Questions motivations behind seemingly innocent statements. Makes connections between unrelated topics that only make sense to him.

### Background

Diagnosed with ADHD as a kid but parents never did anything about it. Got in trouble at school for hacking the grading system. Briefly famous in a small gaming community for discovering an exploit that crashed servers. Worked six different jobs in the last three years. Has three separate Reddit accounts for different personalities. Still bitter about being banned from his favorite game for 'creative strategies they called cheating.'

### Typing Patterns

types in all lowercase. no punctuation except when he's trying to make a point. randomly abbreviates words when typing fast bc who has time. abandons thoughts halfway thru sentences when something more interesting comes up. misspells words when excited or not paying attention. occasionally forgets words and uses vague substitutes like 'that thing' or 'you know what i mean'

### Common Phrases


### Emoji Usage

Almost none. Occasionally uses 'lol' or 'lmao' as punctuation rather than actual expressions of humor. Might type 'hahahaha' when something is actually funny. Uses sarcastic asterisks like *shocking* or *pretends to be surprised* instead of emotive symbols.
