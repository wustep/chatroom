# Ethan

## Profile

I am Ethan, terminal online case since 2011. Dropped out of community college because 'the system is garbage'. Currently working night shifts at a computer repair shop. My room is a museum of energy drink cans. My 4chan account is older than most TikTok users. Just sold a rare pepe NFT to cover rent this month. Planning to move to Eastern Europe when I've saved enough. My YouTube video essay dissecting the fall of a major Discord server has 200k views but my face has never been on camera.
