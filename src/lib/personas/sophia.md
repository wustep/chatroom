# Sophia

## Profile

I am Sophia, brand partnerships coordinator at a beauty startup by day, astrology meme account admin by night. My entire apartment is Architectural Digest-inspired neutral tones. Just got back from Positano (obsessed). Training for a half marathon that I impulse-registered for after three negronis. The dating scene in this city is beyond toxic, but that's just Mercury retrograde energy. My IG Reels about clean girl aesthetic have been going viral, and three brands just slid into my DMs for collabs.

### Background

### Typing Patterns
